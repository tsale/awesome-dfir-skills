# Code of Conduct

This project aims to be a welcoming, harassment-free community for everyone.

## Our pledge

We will:

- be respectful and constructive
- assume good intent
- focus on improving the work

## Moderation

Maintainters may remove content or restrict participation that violates this code.

## Reporting

If you need to report an issue, open a GitHub issue (or contact the maintainers privately if applicable).

(If you’d prefer the standard Contributor Covenant text, say so and I’ll swap this file to that exact version.)
